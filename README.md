# Perpetrator Group-Name prediction using Scikit-Learn

This project analyzed the Global Terrorism Database for the purpose of developing a machine learning algorithm to predict the group-name responsible for the terrorist attacks. The features available in the dataset were all converted into int and float formats by data-preprocessing. The feature selection was done using random forest feature selection and the model was later subject to parameter optimization.
